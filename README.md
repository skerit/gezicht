This is a node.js module that uses `face_recognition` to recognize faces

## Requirements

You'll need to install the `face_recognition` python module and some others.

On Ubuntu 16.04 you'll need to do this:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake python3 python3-pip python3-scipy libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
sudo pip3 install face_recognition
sudo pip3 install opencv-python
```

You'll need to follow [these instructions for the Raspberry Pi](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65).
